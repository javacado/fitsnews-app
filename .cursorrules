# Project: FitsNews (Ionic + Angular + Capacitor)
- Use Angular standalone components & provideRouter.
- Pages live in src/app/pages; services in src/app/core/services.
- Prefer @ionic/storage-angular for simple persistence.
- Code style: strict TypeScript, explicit return types, RxJS pipeable ops.
- Never hardcode secrets; read from environment files.
- When generating Ionic components, default to --standalone.
